# Prime Day Begins July 8th

Amazon, the biggest online shooping outlet is having its annual Prime Day sales, but instead of one day,the company is extending it's sale from July8th until July 11th.

This is the tenth year of Prime Day, and we'd expect Amazon to celebrate with special offers, time-limited discounts, and more. Last year's event saw the company sell over 200 million items! This year, for the first time, shoppers in Ireland and Colombia will be able to participate.

some products that are highlighted include the Apple iPad (11th Gen), the Yeti Tundra 35 Cooler, Ring Doorbell Security Cameras, Beauty and Comsmetic Products just to name a few.

also the new "Today's Big Deals" feature will drop themed daily deals from top brands like Samsung, Kiehl's, and Levi's.

Of course you'll need a Prime Membership to take full advantage off all the deals, but there will be discounts on certain products without a Prime Memberhsip.
