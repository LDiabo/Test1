# The New Line 6 Helix Stadium is Here!!!!

Line 6 has just released their new Guitar/Bass modeler the Helix Stadium. with the original Helix being released back in 2015. Line 6 felt like it was time to upgrade the Helix to compte with its competitors such as the Neural DSP Quad Cortext, Fender Tone Master, and Kemper Profiler.

The new Helix includes a high-resolution 8” touch screen, 12 high-contrast OLED scribble strips, and a built-in expression pedal with toe switch. It also has supports up to four effects loops, four external expression pedals, four external amp control outs, and four drum trigger inputs

Line 6 is also rolling out an entirely new Agoura modeling methodology, which replaces the outgoing HX modeling for “extraordinary sound and responsiveness.” allowing the Helix to finally be able to profile Amps, Cabs, and Pedals.
