# Mobile Experts Skeptical of Trump 'T1' Phone Made-in-America Claims

The team behind Trump Mobile says the T1 phone will be manufactured in the US states, but other expert believe some of the parts inthe phone come from China.

the Trump Mobile T1 smartphone will be American-made To appeal to US consumers, according to the Trump organization—something not even Apple has pulled off with the iPhone.

"Making phones in America. It’s about time we bring products back to our great country," quoted by President Trump's son, Eric Trump.

The American-made claim is already facing skepticism that it's a scam. That's because modern electronics manufacturing has long relied on Asia’s low-cost skilled labor and vast supply chains to produce laptops, smartphones, and game consoles at scale. (One analyst, Max Weinbach, even speculates the T1 is merely a modified Revvl 7 Pro 5G handset from China.)
